# README for Colorific

### James Edwards, October 2016

#### Overview

A simple single-page application that allows the user to make different colors appear on the screen. There are options for black, white, and random color, and the text of the buttons will change to white or black depending on how dark the background is. 

This is the second application I coded with Swift, so I made a few additional changes from the [tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-from-scratch-with-swift-creating-your-first-ios-application--cms-25152) that I based it off of.
